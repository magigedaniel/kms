          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>KENGA MASSIVE SACCO LTD (KMS) was registered in the year 2020 as a co-operative society in response to the economic needs of local professionals and the general local populace. </p>

              Professionals from different sectors felt the compelling need to save together and build a society that can incorporate the local business people and help them access credit which had become difficult getting from the mainstream financial institutions which are scarce within the kuria region.
            </p>

            <p>
              The common business people were then unable to access credit facilities from the mainstream financial institutions due to lack of collateral and other conditionalities. The Society was therefore a result of the vision and initiative of a few professionals who decided to harness their resources by creating a pool out of which members could draw affordable credit facility.
